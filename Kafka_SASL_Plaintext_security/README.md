Implementing SASL_PLAINTEXT Security in Kafka with Spring Boot and Docker Compose

In this article, we will explore how to implement SASL_PLAINTEXT security for a Kafka broker and a Spring Boot application. The setup involves using Docker Compose to orchestrate the Kafka broker and a Spring Boot application. Additionally, a separate Spring Boot client application will consume messages from the Kafka broker.

Apache Kafka provides multiple security mechanisms to secure communication between clients and brokers. One of these mechanisms is SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) with PLAINTEXT, which is used for authentication without encryption.

Prerequisite to run below application:

Install docker and docker-compose" Docker Compose version v2.29.1"

Install Open JDK 17

Note - Here I am running confluent kafka using docker.
